# Notes
For a Library that the maintainers claim will run XNA content, or aims to run all XNA content its is missing the content pipeline, meaning all the original 3D samples and or games which had to use the pipeline (example: SkinnedModel_4_0 sample) to work will not work in FNA. After failing to find a way around that problem in an example form I have no interest in continuing this folder.
As for monogame, their Implementation isnt any better in regards to having things work as they would have worked in XNA, both projects have disregarded compatability for whatever reason so if anyone else finds this find another library before you get stuck searching for what dosent exist.
