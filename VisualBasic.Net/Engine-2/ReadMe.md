# About
The original auther from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) named [AlienScribble](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbxVu_JGFy1UKDRLCFTYanw), posted a series back in Apr 10, 2019 designing a Game Engine with the xna/fna/monogame library using [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

## Conclusion
This is that same GameEngine which you would have ended up with at the end of his [third video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyH45JpPLMU) in the series done in [VisualBasic.Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/), go give his [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6XrMFqMJUBOPVTJrGJnIDDHHF1HTETc) a watch.

## Things you will need
  - [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/) _You must compile this on your own there is no NuGet package_
    - Runtimes
      - you will find the runtimes for [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/) in their [wiki page](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/wiki/1:-Download-and-Update-FNA#2-download-native-libraries)

## Things I added to the current structure
  - Nothing, need to get through the series and then we shall see
