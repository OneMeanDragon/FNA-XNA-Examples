Later Videos in the series that this is from do not work with the latest Monogame, there is missing Functions from the framework itself, aswell as their tool will not compile the provided [".fx"](https://github.com/AlienScribble/SkinMesh180Bones/blob/master/My3DGame/Content/MySkinFX.fx) files any longer. There for what is here is here, I was going to throw it in its own Monogame example folder but its just not worth the time anylonger.

# About
The original auther from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) named [AlienScribble](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbxVu_JGFy1UKDRLCFTYanw), posted a series back in Apr 10, 2019 designing a Game Engine with the xna/fna/monogame library using [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

# NOTE
The series went off course and went into MONOGAME specific function calls, this example will likely not be finished from here on.

## Conclusion
This is that same GameEngine which you would have ended up with at the end of his [third video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyH45JpPLMU) in the series done in [VisualBasic.Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/), go give his [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6XrMFqMJUBOPVTJrGJnIDDHHF1HTETc) a watch.

## Things you will need
  - [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/) _You must compile this on your own there is no NuGet package_
    - Runtimes
      - you will find the runtimes for [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/) in their [wiki page](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/wiki/1:-Download-and-Update-FNA#2-download-native-libraries)

## Things I added to the current structure
  - Nothing, need to get through the series and then we shall see
